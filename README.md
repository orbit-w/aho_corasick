AC automaton, the algorithm uses DAT(double array trie) to construct a finite-state machine and combined the concept of KMP to construct a mismatch pointer.
It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings (the "dictionary") within an input text. It matches all strings simultaneously.
